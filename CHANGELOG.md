# Changelog

All notable changes to Mantel are listed here. Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org); the Home Assistant App, the Docker images and the Python package share one version number.

## Unreleased

The first public release.

- **Mantel Server**: serves HK Frontend's screens without Lovelace, from your Home Assistant's rooms and devices.
- **People and roles**: Mantel accounts with passwords, passkeys and authenticator codes, or sign-in with Home Assistant; Owner, Admin, Adult, Child and Guest roles, with grants per room and feature.
- **Wall tablets**: a browser enrolled as a tablet keeps its own credential and role, whoever is signed in.
- **Commands and audit**: commands are off until the operator turns them on; each one is checked against the person's and the device's role and written to the audit log before it is sent.
- **Music Assistant and cameras** through Mantel, **Mantel Photos** for the screensaver, and **backups**.
- **Mantel Link**: the Home Assistant integration that links Home Assistant to Mantel.
- **Three ways to run it**: the Home Assistant App, Docker Compose, or a Proxmox LXC.

### Fixed before release (engineering audit, October 2026)

Security:
- Changing the Alarm PIN from HK Settings needs a recent sign-in, as its other routes did.
- Room changes in Home Assistant, and rooms given to a person, apply at once to what each person and tablet may see and do.
- A Home Assistant sidebar connection is checked again like any session: a disabled or demoted person loses it.
- The Music Assistant page is signed in only for someone who may play every speaker, with house commands on.
- Mantel Link never sends its credential to an address a network announcement names.
- Live camera and Live TV streams end when the right to watch them ends; a camera hidden from someone can't be watched by its id.
- Entities named inside a command's data (joined speakers, a camera cast to a TV) are checked like its target; a wall tablet may watch cameras and talk at the door, not turn cameras off or record them.
- Sign-in: a right password no longer resets the count of wrong authenticator codes; adding an authenticator or passkey needs a recent sign-in; replacing an authenticator keeps the old one working until the new one is confirmed; Confirm It Is You accepts only your own passkey.
- Visitors through the Cloudflare tunnel are each their own address (one person's wrong passwords no longer slow everyone's sign-in from away).
- HK Frontend: the artwork proxy fetches only Music Assistant's image proxy on the home network, whatever `..` a link carries; five wrong PINs lock an Alarm PIN panel for 15 minutes.

Reliability:
- Screens follow the house again after the connection to Mantel drops.
- Screens and tablets follow All Screens' and All Tablets' settings (menu, tab bar, screensaver, Return to Home When Idle).
- Category notifications (doors, leaks, smoke) work right after Mantel starts.
- Docker and LXC: browser notifications and pairing the iPhone, iPad and Mac apps work (their keys live in the data folder, and in backups).
- Backups: a backup made by hand deletes no older ones; a database-only restore keeps your photos; leftovers of an interrupted backup are cleaned up.
- Push notifications survive an internet outage, and stop at an app that was signed out.
